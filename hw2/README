Homework 2: BEB Simulation (Link Layer CSMA/CD Exercise)

Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) is used to detect collisions beteen frames and retransmit in a timely manner. The 
specifications of the program design are as follows: 

- number_of_nodes - number of Node's that will participate in the BEB simulation.
- number_of_time_slots is the total number of time slots for the BEB simulation
- probability_node_sendFrame is the probability that a Node will actively tries to send Frame in a
  time slot
